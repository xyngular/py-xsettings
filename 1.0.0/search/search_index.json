Settings SettingsField SettingsRetrieverProtocol Settings \u00b6 This is the core class that Settings implementations will inherit from. Settings can be used as source for external settings / variables that a given application / library needs in order to function. It provides future developers an easy way to see what these external variables are and where they are derived from. In its simplest form a Settings class implementation is simply a class similar to a @dataclass that inherits from a given Settings base class. Example Settings File 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 from xsettings import Settings , SettingsField class MySettings ( Settings ): a : int b : int = 1 c = \"1\" # For Full Customization, allocate SettingsField: d : str = SettingsField ( ... ) Each of these attributes will be converted to a SettingsField object to control future value lookup. Each part on the attribute (name, type_hint, default_value) will be reflected in the SettingsField. If you want more customization you can set a SettingsField() as your default value and the fields set in that will be overridden in the main SettingsField object. Settings usage \u00b6 Class/Lazy Attribute Lookup \u00b6 Referencing the attribute at the class level will return a SettingsClassProperty rather than a SettingsField (or the default value). This is useful when you want to do property chaining, or you want to use a property as a property in another class 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 from xsettings import Settings , EnvVarSettings import os class MySettings ( Settings ): table_name : str MySettings . grab () . table_name = \"the-t-name\" class MyTable : class Meta : # Here, we set a forward-ref class property # to be whatever the current setting of `MySettings.table_name` # will be (it's a property and will look it up each time # its asked for). table_name = MySettings . table_name # Forward-ref is resolved via lazy-forward-ref, # each time it's asked for: assert MyTable . Meta . table_name == 'the-t-name' with MySettings ( table_name = 'alt-table-name' ): assert MyTable . Meta . table_name == 'alt-table-name' # Inherit from EnvVarSettings, so it will retrieve our settings # via environmental variables # (will use env-vars on-demand if value is not set directly on it). class MyEnvSettings ( EnvVarSettings ): my_table_name : str os . environ [ 'MY_TABLE_NAME' ] = 'env-table-name' # We can directly set the setting on MySettings to a lazy-prop-ref # and so now this setting will reflect what's the current value # in `MyEnvSettings.my_table_name` is; and `MyEnvSettings` will # retrieve its value from environmental variables # since it inherits from `EnvVarSettings`. # MySettings . grab () . table_name = MyEnvSettings . my_table_name assert MySettings . grab () . table_name == 'env-table-name' # Example 3, default value of settings field can be a lazy-property-ref class MyOtherSettings ( Settings ): my_setting_attr : str = MyEnvSettings . my_table_name my_other_settings = MyOtherSettings . proxy () assert my_other_settings . my_setting_attr == 'env-table-name' os . environ [ 'MY_TABLE_NAME' ] = 'env-table-2' assert my_other_settings . my_setting_attr == 'env-table-2' Change Default Value \u00b6 You can now (as of v1.3) change the default value on an already created Settings subclass: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 from xsettings import Settings , SettingsField class MySettings ( Settings ): a : int b : int = 1 # Change default value later on; # Now the `MySettings.a` will have a # default/fallback value of `2`: MySettings . a = 2 class MyOtherSettings ( Settings ): some_other_setting : str # You can also set a lazy-ref as setting field's # default value after it's class is created. # (also if the type-hint's don't match it will convert # the value as needed like you would expect. MyOtherSettings . some_other_setting = MySettings . b # It's a str now, since `MyOtherSettings.some_other_setting` # has a str typehint: assert MyOtherSettings . grab () . some_other_setting == '1' Setting New Setting on Class Attributes \u00b6 You can't create new settings attributes/fields on a Settings subclass after the class is created (only during class creation). You can set/change the default value for an existing settings attribute by simply assigning to it as a class attribute (see topic Change Default Value ). Class Instance Attribute lookup \u00b6 Setting classes inherit from 1xinject.Dependency and as such are considered singletons. Instances should not be created. Instead, to access an instance you should do MySettings.grab() ; or you can use an MySettings.proxy() , ie: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 my_settings = MySettings . proxy () # Can use `my_settings` just like `MySettings.grab().table_name`, print ( my_settings . table_name ) # You can also import the `my_settings` proxy into other modules, # for use elsewhere. from my_project.settings import my_settings print ( my_settings . table_name ) Proxies are directly importable into other files, the proxy will lookup the current dependency/singletone instance every time you access it for normal attributes and methods (anything starting with a _ /underscore is not proxied). To lookup the value of a given settings simply reference it on the Singleton instance via MySettings.grab().table_name . This will cause a lookup to happen. Inheriting from Plain Classes \u00b6 Currently, there is a something to watch out for when you also inherit from a plain class for you Settings subclass. For now, we treat all plain super-class values on attributes as-if they were directly assigned to the settings instance; ie: we will NOT try to 'retrieve' the value unless the value is set to xsentinels.Default in either the instance or superclass (whatever value it finds via normal python attribute retrieval rules). You can use xsentinels.Default to force Settings to lookup the value and/or use its default value if it has one. May in the future create a v2 of xsettings someday that will look at attributes directly assigned to self, then and retrieved value, then any plain super-class set value. (For a more clear example of this, see unit test method test_super_class_with_default_value_uses_retriever ) SettingsField \u00b6 Provides value lookup configuration and functionality. It controls how a source value is retrieved xsettings.fields.SettingsField.retriever and converted xsettings.fields.SettingsField.converter . If there is not SettingsField used/generated for an attribute, then it's just a normal attribute. No special features of the Settings class such as lazy/forward-references will work with them. How SettingsField is Generated \u00b6 Right now, a SettingsField is only automatically generated for annotated attributes. Also, one is generated for any @property functions (you must define a return type-hint for property). Normal functions currently DO NOT generate a field, also attributes without a type annotation will also not automatically be generated. Anything starting with an _ will not have a field generated for it, they are for use by properties/methods on the class and work like normal. You can also generate your own SettingsField with custom options by creating one and setting it on a class attribute, during the class creation process. After a class is created, you can't change or add SettingFields to it anymore, currently. Examples: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 from xsettings import Settings , SettingsField class MySettings ( Settings ): custom_field : str = SettingsField ( required = False ) # SettingsField auto-generated for `a`: a : str # A Field is generated for `b`, the type-hint will be `type(2)`. b = 2 # A field is NOT generated for anything that starts with an underscore (`_`), # They are considered internal attributes, and no Field is ever generated for them. _some_private_attr = 4 # Field generated for `my_property`, it will be the fields 'retriever'. @property def my_property ( self ) -> str : return \"hello\" # No field is generated for `normal_method`: # Currently, any directly callable object/function as a class attribute value # will never allow you to have a Field generated for it. def normal_method ( self ): pass Converters \u00b6 When Settings gets a value due to someone asking for an attribute on it's self, it will attempt to convert the value if the value does not match the type-hint. To find a converter, we check these in order, first one found is what we use: We first check self.converter . Next, DEFAULT_CONVERTERS Finally, we fall back to using the type-hint (ie: int(value) or str(value) ). This also enables types that inherit from Enum to work: ie: plain values will be converted into one of the enum's values. If the retrieved value does not match the type-hint, it will run the converter by calling it and passing the value to convert. The value to convert is whatever value was set, retrieved. It can also be the field's default-value if noting is set/retreived. Properties \u00b6 Supports Read-Only Properties \u00b6 The Settings class also supports read-only properties, they are placed in a SettingField's retriever (ie: xsettings.fields.SettingField.retriever ). When you access a value from a read-only property, when the value needs to be retrieved, it will use the property as a way to fetch the 'storage' aspect of the field/attribute. All other aspects of the process behave as it would for any other field. This means in particular, after the field returns its value Settings will check the returned values type against the field's type_hint, and if needed will convert it if needed before handing it to the thing that originally requested the attribute/value. It also means that, if the Settings instance has a plain-value directly assigned to it, that value will be used and the property will not be called at all (since no value needs to be 'retrieved'). In effect, the property getter will only be called if a retrieved value is needed for the attribute. Here is an example below. Notice I have a type-hint for the return-type of the property. This is used if there is no type-annotation defined for the field. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 from xsettings import Settings from decimal import Decimal class MySettings ( Settings ): @property def some_setting ( self ) -> Decimal : return \"1.34\" assert MySettings . grab () . some_setting == Decimal ( \"1.34\" ) You can also define a type-annotation at the class level for the property like so: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 from xsettings import Settings from decimal import Decimal class MySettings ( Settings ): # Does not matter if this is before or after the property, # Python stores type annotations in a separate area # vs normal class attribute values in Python. some_setting : Decimal @property def some_setting ( self ): return \"1.34\" assert MySettings . grab () . some_setting == Decimal ( \"1.34\" ) Getter Properties Supported as a Forward/Lazy-Reference \u00b6 You can get a forward-ref for a property field on a Settings class, just like any other field attribute on a Settings class: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 from xsettings import Settings from decimal import Decimal class MySettings ( Settings ): # Does not matter if this is before or after the property, # Python stores type annotations in a separate area # vs normal class attribute values in Python. some_setting : Decimal @property def some_setting ( self ) -> Decimal : return \"1.34\" class OtherSettings ( Settings ): other_setting : str = MySettings . some_setting assert OtherSettings . grab () . other_setting == \"1.34\" In the example above, I also illustrate that a forward-ref will still pay-attention to the type-hint assigned to the field. It's still converted as you would expect, in this case we convert a Decimal object into a str object when the value for other_setting is asked for. Getter Property with Custom SettingsField \u00b6 You can also specify a custom SettingsField and still use a property with it. Below is an example. See xsettings.fields.SettingsField.getter for more details. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 from xsettings import Settings , SettingsField class MySettings ( Settings ): # Does not matter if this is before or after the property, # Python stores type annotations in a separate area # vs normal class attribute values in # Python. some_setting : str = SettingsField ( required = False ) @some_setting . getter def some_setting ( self ): return \"1.36\" assert MySettings . grab () . some_setting == \"1.36\" Setter Properties Currently Unsupported \u00b6 You can't currently have a setter defined for a property on a class. This is something we CAN support without too much trouble, but have decided to put off for a future, if we end up wanting to do it. If you define a setter property on a Settings class, it will currently raise an error. SettingsRetriever \u00b6 Its responsibility is providing functionality to retrieve a variable from some sort of variable store. The SettingsRetrieverProtocol provides the callable protocol. You can set a default-retriever to be used as a fallback if no other value is set or other non-default retrievers can't find a value by using a class-argument like so: 1 2 3 from xsettings import Settings class MySettings ( Settings , default_retrievers = my_retriever ): some_setting : str How Setting Field Values Are Resolved \u00b6 Summary \u00b6 In General, this order is how things are resolved with more detail to follow: Value set directly on Setting-subclass instance. via MySettings.grab().some_setting = 'some-set-value Value set on a parent-instance in XContext.dependency_chain(for_type=SettingsSubclass) . Settings can be used as context-managers via with and decorators @ . When a new Settings instance is activated via decorator/with and previously active setting is in it's parent-chain which is resolved via it's dependency-chain ( XContext.grab().dependency_chain(for_type=SettingsSubclass) ). Example: with MySetting(some_setting='parent-value'): Retrievers are consulted next. First, retriever set directly on field xsettings.fields.SettingsField.retriever . This can include any field properties @property , they are set as the field retriever. Next, instance retriever(s) set directly on the Setting object that is being asked for its field value is checked. via Settings.add_instance_retrievers . Then any instance-retrievers in the dependency-chain are checked next (see step 2 above for more details). Default-retrievers assigned to the class(es) are next checked, in mro order. Finally, any default-value for the field is consulted. If the default-value is a property, or forward-ref then that is followed. ie: Settings.some_attr = OtherSettings.another_attr_to_forward_ref_with This ^ will change the default value for some_attr to a forward-ref from another Settings class. Keep in mind that generally, if a value is a property (including forward-refs, which are also properties), they are followed via the standard __get__ mechanism (see earlier in document for forward-ref details). Resolution Details \u00b6 Values set directly on Setting instances are first checked for and used if one is found. Checks self first, if not found will next check XContext.grab().dependency_chain(for_type=SettingsSubclass) (returns a list of each instance currently in the dependency-chain, each one is checked in order; see link for details). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 from xsettings import Settings , SettingsField def my_retriever ( * , field : SettingsField , settings : Settings ): return f \"retrieved- { field . name } \" class MySettings ( Settings , default_retrievers = my_retriever ): some_setting : str assert MySettings . grab () . some_setting == 'retrieved-some_setting' If value can't be found the retrievers are next checked. Retrievers are tried in a specific order, the first one with a non-None retrieved value is the one that is used. After the individual field retrievers are consulted, instance retrievers are checked next before finally checking the default-retrievers for the entire class. You can also add one or more retrievers to this instance of settings via the Settings.add_instance_retrievers method (won't modify default_retrievers for the entire class, only modifies this specific instance). They are checked in the order added. Child dependencies (of the same exactly class/type) in the XContext.dependency_chain(for_type=SettingsSubclass) will also check these instance-retrievers. The dependency chain is checked in the expected order of first consulting self, then the chain in most recent parent first order. For more details on how parent/child dependencies work see XContext.dependency_chain . After the dependency-chain is checked, the default-retrievers are checked in python's mro (method-resolution-order), checking its own class first before checking any super-classes for default-retrievers. Things to Watch Out For \u00b6 If a field has not type-hint, but does have a normal (non-property) default-value, The type of the default-value will be used for type-hint. If a field has no converter, it will use the type-hint as the converter by default. Every field must have a type-hint, otherwise an exception will be raised.","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"#install","text":"1 2 3 4 5 # via pip pip install xloop # via poetry poetry add xloop","title":"Install"},{"location":"#introduction","text":"Helps document and centralizing settings in a python project/library.

To find a converter, we check these in order, first one found is what we use: We first check self.converter . Next, DEFAULT_CONVERTERS Finally, we fall back to using the type-hint (ie: int(value) or str(value) ). This also enables types that inherit from Enum to work: ie: plain values will be converted into one of the enum's values. If the retrieved value does not match the type-hint, it will run the converter by calling it and passing the value to convert. The value to convert is whatever value was set, retrieved. It can also be the field's default-value if noting is set/retreived.","title":"Converters"},{"location":"#properties","text":"","title":"Properties"},{"location":"#supports-read-only-properties","text":"The Settings class also supports read-only properties, they are placed in a SettingField's retriever (ie: xsettings.fields.SettingField.retriever ). When you access a value from a read-only property, when the value needs to be retrieved, it will use the property as a way to fetch the 'storage' aspect of the field/attribute. All other aspects of the process behave as it would for any other field. This means in particular, after the field returns its value Settings will check the returned values type against the field's type_hint, and if needed will convert it if needed before handing it to the thing that originally requested the attribute/value. It also means that, if the Settings instance has a plain-value directly assigned to it, that value will be used and the property will not be called at all (since no value needs to be 'retrieved'). In effect, the property getter will only be called if a retrieved value is needed for the attribute. Here is an example below. Notice I have a type-hint for the return-type of the property.
