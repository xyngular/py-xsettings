<h1 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h1>
<h2 id="please-read-first">Please Read First</h2>
<p>If your looking for a simple example/use of singltone-like dependencies,
go to <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code>.</p>
<p>The whole point of the <code><a title="xinject.context.XContext" href="#xinject.context.XContext">XContext</a></code> is to have a place to get shared dependencies.</p>
<p>Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:</p>
<p>Most of the time a dependency will inherit from <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code> and that
class provides a class method <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab">Dependency.grab()</a></code> to easily get a
dependency of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.</p>
<p>So normally, code would do this to get the current object instance for a Resource:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Dependency):
&gt;&gt;&gt;    my_attribute = &quot;default-value&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to interact with current Dependency subclass object:
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.grab().my_attribute = &quot;change-value&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Another convenient way to get the current dependency is via the
<code><a title="xinject.proxy.CurrentDependencyProxy" href="proxy.html#xinject.proxy.CurrentDependencyProxy">CurrentDependencyProxy</a></code>. This class lets you create an object
that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
and use it directly.</p>
<p>I would start with <a href="#fundamentals">Fundamentals</a> if you know nothing of how
<code><a title="xinject.context.XContext" href="#xinject.context.XContext">XContext</a></code> works and want to learn more about how it works.</p>
<p>Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
<code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code>.
So getting familiar with Context is more about
utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="admonition-title">Important:&ensp;The below is for advanced use-cases and understanding.</p>
<p>Look at <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code> or docs just above ^^^ for the normal use-case and
examples / quick starts.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="context-overview">Context Overview</h1>
<p>Context is used to keep track of a set of dependencies. The dependencies are keyed off the class
type. IE: One dependency per-context per-dependency-type.</p>
<p>Main Classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a title="xinject.context.XContext" href="#xinject.context.XContext">XContext</a></code>: Container of dependencies, mapped by type.</li>
<li>For Resource Subclasses:<ul>
<li><code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code>: Nice interface to easily get the current dependency.
Used to implment a something that should be shared and not generally duplicated,
like a soft-singleton.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h1>
<p><code><a title="xinject.context.XContext" href="#xinject.context.XContext">XContext</a></code> is like a container, used to store various objects we are calling
dependencies.</p>
<p>Used to store various dependencies of any type
in general [ie: configs, auths, clients, etc].
All of these dependencies together represent a sort of "context" from which various pieces of code
can easily get them; that way they can 'share' the dependency when appropriate. This is a way
to do dependcy injection in a easier and more reliable way since you don't have to worry
about passing these dependencies around everywhere manually.</p>
<p>The values are mapped by their type.
When a dependency of a specific type is asked for,
the Context will return it if it finds it. If not found it will create it, add it to its self
and return it. Future calls will return this new dependency.</p>
<p><code><a title="xinject.context.XContext" href="#xinject.context.XContext">XContext</a></code> can optionally have a parent. By default, a newly created/used Context
will use the current context Normally, dependencies are still normally created even if a
parent has a value, as long as the current context does not have one yet.</p>
<p>This behavior can be customized by the dependency, see one of these for details:</p>
<ul>
<li><code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code><ul>
<li>Useful for a shared/soft overridable shared object; where you can easily get the current
version of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>There are various ways to get dependencies from the current context. Let's say we have
a dependency called <code>SomeResourceType</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; next_identifier = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResourceType(Dependency):
...     def __init__(self):
...         global next_identifier
...         self.some_value = &quot;hello!&quot;
...         self.ident = next_identifier
...         next_identifier += 1
</code></pre>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note:&ensp;SomeResourceType's <code>ident</code> field gets incremented and set on each newly created object.</p>
<p>So the first SomeResoureType's <code>ident</code> will equal <code>0</code>,
the second one created will be <code>1</code> and so forth.</p>
</div>
<p>If what you want inherits from <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code>, it has a nice class method that
returns the current dependency.
The easiest way to get the current dependency for the type in this case is
to call <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab">Dependency.grab()</a></code> on it's type like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.grab().some_value
'hello!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.grab().ident
0
</code></pre>
<p>When a Context does not have the dependency, by default it will create it for you, as you
saw in the previous example.</p>
<p><code><a title="xinject.context.XContext.current" href="#xinject.context.XContext.current">XContext.current()</a></code> will return the current Context if no params are passed in, or if a
type is passed in, it will return the current Context's dependency for the passed in type.</p>
<p>This means another way to grab dependencies is to get the current <code><a title="xinject.context.XContext.current" href="#xinject.context.XContext.current">XContext.current()</a></code>,
and then ask it for the dependency like below. This works for any type, including
types that don't inherit from <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; XContext.grab().grab(SomeResourceType).some_value
'hello!'
</code></pre>
<p>If you pass a type into <code><a title="xinject.context.XContext.current" href="#xinject.context.XContext.current">XContext.current()</a></code>, it will do the above ^ for you:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; XContext.current(SomeResourceType).some_value
'hello!'
&gt;&gt;&gt; XContext.current(SomeResourceType).ident
0
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it still returns the same object [ie: <code>ident == 0</code>]</p>
<h2 id="activating-new-resource">Activating New Resource</h2>
<p>You can easily create a new dependency, configure it however you like and then 'activate' it,
so it's the current version of that dependency. This allows you to 'override' and activate your
own copy of a dependency.</p>
<p>You can do it via one of the below listed methods/examples below.</p>
<p>For these examples, say I have this dependency defined:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; from dataclasses import dataclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; from xinject import Dependency
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; @dataclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyResource(Dependency):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     some_value = 'default-value'
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; assert MyResource.grab().some_value == 'default-value'
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Use desired <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code> subclass as a method decorator:<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; @MyResource(some_value='new-value')
&gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method():
&gt;&gt;&gt;     assert MyResource.grab().some_value == 'new-value'
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="activating-new-context">Activating New Context</h2>
<p>When you create a new context, you can activate it to make it the current context in four ways
(listed below).</p>
<ol>
<li>Via the <code>with</code> statement.</li>
<li>As a method dectorator, ie: <code>@</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>with</code> or <code>@</code> for a <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code>,
that will create and activate a new <code>UContext</code> with the newley activated dependency in it.</li>
<li>When running a unit-test where xinject is installed as a dependency,
because the <code>xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context</code> fixture is auto-used in this case.
This fixture creates a new <code>UContext with a </code>None` parent;
that will isolate dependencies between each run of a unit test method.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Here are examples of the four ways to create/activate a new context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; with XContext():
...     SomeResourceType.grab().ident
1
</code></pre>
<p>This is stack-able as well; as in this can keep track of a stack of contexts, in a
thread-safe way.</p>
<p>When the context manager or decorated method is exited, it will pop-off the context,
and it won't
be the default one anymore. Whatever the default one was before you entered the <code>with</code> will
be the default once more.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext():
&gt;&gt;&gt; def a_decorated_method():
...     return SomeResourceType.grab().ident
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_decorated_method()
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_decorated_method()
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.grab().ident
0
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, after the method exits the old context takes over, and it already had the
older version of the dependency and so returns that one.</p>
<p>By default, a context will create a dependency when it's asked for it, and it does not have it
already. As you saw above, every time a blank Context was created, it also created a new
SomeResourceType when it was asked for it because the new blank <code><a title="xinject.context.XContext" href="#xinject.context.XContext">XContext</a></code>
did not already have the dependency.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; with XContext():
&gt;&gt;&gt;     SomeResourceType.grab().ident
4
</code></pre>
<p>There is a pytest plugin with an auto-use fixture that will create brand-new app + thread root
UContext's; so that each unit test function run will start with no dependecies from other tests.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; def test_some_text(context):
...    # This is guaranteed to be a newly created &lt;code&gt;SomeResourceType&lt;/code&gt;.
...    SomeResourceType.grab()
</code></pre>
<p>There are ways to share dependency in a parent Context that a new blank context would beable
to use. But that's more advanced usage. The above should be enough to get you started quickly.
See below for more advanced usage patterns.</p>
<h1 id="parents">Parents</h1>
<p>A Context can have a parent (<code><a title="xinject.context.XContext.parent" href="#xinject.context.XContext.parent">XContext.parent</a></code>) or event a chain of them (<code><a title="xinject.context.XContext.parent_chain" href="#xinject.context.XContext.parent_chain">XContext.parent_chain()</a></code>)</p>
<p>Because it's the safest thing to do by default for naive dependencies, Context's normally don't
consult parents for basic dependencies, they will just create them if they don't already have them.</p>
<p>You can customize this behavior. There are some default dependency base classes that will implment
a few common patterns for you. You can see how they work to get ideas, and customize the process
for your own dependency when needed. See <a href="#dependency-base-classes.">Resource Base Classes</a> below for
more details on how to do that.</p>
<p>You can make an isolated Context by doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; XContext(parent=None)
</code></pre>
<p>When creating a new context. This will tell the context NOT to use a parent. By default, a
Context will use the current Context as the time the Context was created as it's parent.
See <code><a title="xinject.context.XContext.parent" href="#xinject.context.XContext.parent">XContext.parent</a></code> for more details.</p>
<p>This is also how the Context test fixture works (see <code>xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context</code>).
It creates a new parent-less context and activates it while the fixture is used.</p>
<h1 id="resource-base-classes">Resource Base Classes</h1>
<h3 id="dependency"><code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code></h3>
<p>You can implment the singleton-pattern easily by inherting from the
<code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code> class.
This will try it's best to ensure only one dependency is used amoung a chain/tree of parents.
It does this by returning <code>self</code> when <code><a title="xinject.context.XContext" href="#xinject.context.XContext">XContext</a></code> asks it what it wants to do when
a child-context asks for the dependency of a specific type.</p>
<p>Since <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code> can be shared amoung many diffrent child Context objects,
and makes the same instance always 'look' like it's the current one;
generally only one is every made or used.</p>
<p>However, you can create a new Context, make it current and put a diffrent instance of the
dependency in it to 'override' this behavior.
See <a href="#activating-new-dependency">Activating New Resource</a> for more details.</p>
<h4 id="example">Example</h4>
<p>I create a new class that uses our previous <a href="#dependencies">SomeResourceType</a> but adds in a
<code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; class MySingleton(SomeResourceType, Dependency):
...     pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; MySingleton.grab().ident
5
</code></pre>
<p>Now watch as I do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; with XContext():
...     MySingleton.grab().ident
5
</code></pre>
<p>The same dependency is kept when making a child-context. However, if you make a parent-less
context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python-repl">&gt;&gt;&gt; with XContext(parent=None):
...     MySingleton.grab().ident
6
</code></pre>
<p>The <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code> will not see pased the parent-less context,
and so won't see the old dependency.
It will create a new one. The <code><a title="xinject.dependency.Dependency" href="dependency.html#xinject.dependency.Dependency">Dependency</a></code> will still create it in the
furtherest parent it can&hellip; which in this case was the <code><a title="xinject.context.XContext" href="#xinject.context.XContext">XContext</a></code> activated by the

# To Do First:

If you have not already, to get a nice high-level overview of library see either:

- project README.md here:
    - https://github.com/xyngular/py-xinject#documentation
- Or go to xinject module documentation at here:
    - [xinject, How To Use](./#how-to-use)


# Quick Start

## Please Read First

If your looking for a simple example/use of singltone-like dependencies,
go to `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.

The whole point of the `xinject.context.XContext` is to have a place to get shared dependencies.

Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

Most of the time a dependency will inherit from `xinject.dependency.Dependency` and that
class provides a class method `xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab` to easily get a
dependency of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

So normally, code would do this to get the current object instance for a Resource:

&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Dependency):
&gt;&gt;&gt;    my_attribute = &#34;default-value&#34;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to interact with current Dependency subclass object:
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.grab().my_attribute = &#34;change-value&#34;

Another convenient way to get the current dependency is via the
`xinject.proxy.CurrentDependencyProxy`. This class lets you create an object
that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
and use it directly.

I would start with [Fundamentals](#fundamentals) if you know nothing of how
`xinject.context.XContext` works and want to learn more about how it works.

Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
`xinject.dependency.Dependency`.  So getting familiar with Context is more about
utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

.. important:: The below is for advanced use-cases and understanding.
    Look at `xinject.dependency.Dependency` or docs just above ^^^ for the normal use-case and
    examples / quick starts.

# Context Overview

Context is used to keep track of a set of dependencies. The dependencies are keyed off the class
type. IE: One dependency per-context per-dependency-type.

Main Classes:

- `xinject.context.XContext`: Container of dependencies, mapped by type.
- For Resource Subclasses:
    - `xinject.dependency.Dependency`: Nice interface to easily get the current dependency.
        Used to implment a something that should be shared and not generally duplicated,
        like a soft-singleton.

# Fundamentals

`xinject.context.XContext` is like a container, used to store various objects we are calling
dependencies.

Used to store various dependencies of any type  in general [ie: configs, auths, clients, etc].
All of these dependencies together represent a sort of &#34;context&#34; from which various pieces of code
can easily get them; that way they can &#39;share&#39; the dependency when appropriate. This is a way
to do dependcy injection in a easier and more reliable way since you don&#39;t have to worry
about passing these dependencies around everywhere manually.

The values are mapped by their type.  When a dependency of a specific type is asked for,
the Context will return it if it finds it. If not found it will create it, add it to its self
and return it. Future calls will return this new dependency.

`xinject.context.XContext` can optionally have a parent. By default, a newly created/used Context
will use the current context Normally, dependencies are still normally created even if a
parent has a value, as long as the current context does not have one yet.

This behavior can be customized by the dependency, see one of these for details:

- `xinject.dependency.Dependency`
    - Useful for a shared/soft overridable shared object; where you can easily get the current
        version of it.


## Dependencies
[dependencies]: #dependencies

There are various ways to get dependencies from the current context. Let&#39;s say we have
a dependency called `SomeResourceType`:

&gt;&gt;&gt; next_identifier = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResourceType(Dependency):
...     def __init__(self):
...         global next_identifier
...         self.some_value = &#34;hello!&#34;
...         self.ident = next_identifier
...         next_identifier += 1

.. note:: SomeResourceType&#39;s `ident` field gets incremented and set on each newly created object.
    So the first SomeResoureType&#39;s `ident` will equal `0`,
    the second one created will be `1` and so forth.

If what you want inherits from `xinject.dependency.Dependency`, it has a nice class method that
returns the current dependency.
The easiest way to get the current dependency for the type in this case is
to call `xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab` on it&#39;s type like so:

&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.grab().some_value
&#39;hello!&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.grab().ident
0

When a Context does not have the dependency, by default it will create it for you, as you
saw in the previous example.

`XContext.current()` will return the current Context if no params are passed in, or if a
type is passed in, it will return the current Context&#39;s dependency for the passed in type.

This means another way to grab dependencies is to get the current `XContext.current`,
and then ask it for the dependency like below. This works for any type, including
types that don&#39;t inherit from `xinject.dependency.Dependency`:

&gt;&gt;&gt; XContext.grab().grab(SomeResourceType).some_value
&#39;hello!&#39;

If you pass a type into `XContext.current`, it will do the above ^ for you:

&gt;&gt;&gt; XContext.current(SomeResourceType).some_value
&#39;hello!&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt; XContext.current(SomeResourceType).ident
0

As you can see, it still returns the same object [ie: `ident == 0`]

## Activating New Resource

You can easily create a new dependency, configure it however you like and then &#39;activate&#39; it,
so it&#39;s the current version of that dependency. This allows you to &#39;override&#39; and activate your
own copy of a dependency.

You can do it via one of the below listed methods/examples below.

For these examples, say I have this dependency defined:

&gt;&gt;&gt; from dataclasses import dataclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; from xinject import Dependency
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; @dataclass
&gt;&gt;&gt; class MyResource(Dependency):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     some_value = &#39;default-value&#39;
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; assert MyResource.grab().some_value == &#39;default-value&#39;

- Use desired `xinject.dependency.Dependency` subclass as a method decorator:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @MyResource(some_value=&#39;new-value&#39;)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def my_method():
        &gt;&gt;&gt;     assert MyResource.grab().some_value == &#39;new-value&#39;

## Activating New Context

When you create a new context, you can activate it to make it the current context in four ways
(listed below).

1. Via the `with` statement.
2. As a method dectorator, ie: `@`.
3. Using `with` or `@` for a `xinject.dependency.Dependency`,
    that will create and activate a new `UContext` with the newley activated dependency in it.
3. When running a unit-test where xinject is installed as a dependency,
    because the `xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context` fixture is auto-used in this case.
    This fixture creates a new `UContext with a `None` parent;
    that will isolate dependencies between each run of a unit test method.

### Examples

Here are examples of the four ways to create/activate a new context:

&gt;&gt;&gt; with XContext():
...     SomeResourceType.grab().ident
1

This is stack-able as well; as in this can keep track of a stack of contexts, in a
thread-safe way.

When the context manager or decorated method is exited, it will pop-off the context,
and it won&#39;t
be the default one anymore. Whatever the default one was before you entered the `with` will
be the default once more.

&gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext():
&gt;&gt;&gt; def a_decorated_method():
...     return SomeResourceType.grab().ident
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_decorated_method()
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a_decorated_method()
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResourceType.grab().ident
0

As you can see, after the method exits the old context takes over, and it already had the
older version of the dependency and so returns that one.

By default, a context will create a dependency when it&#39;s asked for it, and it does not have it
already. As you saw above, every time a blank Context was created, it also created a new
SomeResourceType when it was asked for it because the new blank `xinject.context.XContext`
did not already have the dependency.


&gt;&gt;&gt; with XContext():
&gt;&gt;&gt;     SomeResourceType.grab().ident
4

There is a pytest plugin with an auto-use fixture that will create brand-new app + thread root
UContext&#39;s; so that each unit test function run will start with no dependecies from other tests.

&gt;&gt;&gt; def test_some_text(context):
...    # This is guaranteed to be a newly created `SomeResourceType`.
...    SomeResourceType.grab()



There are ways to share dependency in a parent Context that a new blank context would beable
to use. But that&#39;s more advanced usage. The above should be enough to get you started quickly.
See below for more advanced usage patterns.

# Parents

A Context can have a parent (`XContext.parent`) or event a chain of them (`XContext.parent_chain`)

Because it&#39;s the safest thing to do by default for naive dependencies, Context&#39;s normally don&#39;t
consult parents for basic dependencies, they will just create them if they don&#39;t already have them.

You can customize this behavior. There are some default dependency base classes that will implment
a few common patterns for you. You can see how they work to get ideas, and customize the process
for your own dependency when needed. See [Resource Base Classes][dependency-base-classes] below for
more details on how to do that.

You can make an isolated Context by doing:

&gt;&gt;&gt; XContext(parent=None)

When creating a new context. This will tell the context NOT to use a parent. By default, a
Context will use the current Context as the time the Context was created as it&#39;s parent.
See `XContext.parent` for more details.

This is also how the Context test fixture works (see `xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context`).
It creates a new parent-less context and activates it while the fixture is used.

# Resource Base Classes
[dependency-base-classes]: #dependency-base-classes.

### `xinject.dependency.Dependency`

You can implment the singleton-pattern easily by inherting from the
`xinject.dependency.Dependency` class.
This will try it&#39;s best to ensure only one dependency is used amoung a chain/tree of parents.
It does this by returning `self` when `xinject.context.XContext` asks it what it wants to do when
a child-context asks for the dependency of a specific type.

Since `xinject.dependency.Dependency` can be shared amoung many diffrent child Context objects,
and makes the same instance always &#39;look&#39; like it&#39;s the current one;
generally only one is every made or used.

However, you can create a new Context, make it current and put a diffrent instance of the
dependency in it to &#39;override&#39; this behavior.
See [Activating New Resource](#activating-new-dependency) for more details.

#### Example

I create a new class that uses our previous [SomeResourceType][dependencies] but adds in a
`xinject.dependency.Dependency`.

&gt;&gt;&gt; class MySingleton(SomeResourceType, Dependency):
...     pass
&gt;&gt;&gt; MySingleton.grab().ident
5

Now watch as I do this:

&gt;&gt;&gt; with XContext():
...     MySingleton.grab().ident
5

The same dependency is kept when making a child-context. However, if you make a parent-less
context:

&gt;&gt;&gt; with XContext(parent=None):
...     MySingleton.grab().ident
6

The `xinject.dependency.Dependency` will not see pased the parent-less context,
and so won&#39;t see the old dependency.
It will create a new one. The `xinject.dependency.Dependency` will still create it in the
furtherest parent it can... which in this case was the `xinject.context.XContext` activated by the
with statement.

    I based this off how None works in Python [ie: a None + NoneType]
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    pass


_TreatAsRootParent = _TreatAsRootParentType()
&#34;&#34;&#34; Can be used for the parent of a new `XContext`, it will make the context a root-like
    context. What this means is the parent is treated as if you set it to `None` while at the
    same time altering the copying/activating behavior.

    When you make a copy of a root-like `XContext` and activate the copy.
    When this happens the new context will use the currently activated context as it&#39;s parent.

    Normally when you pass in `None` as the parent of a new context, ie:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; XContext(parent=None)

    New copies of that context object will have their parent set as None.

    For a root-like context created like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; XContext(parent=_TreatAsRootParent)

    When activating this context, it will make a copy and have it&#39;s parent set as None.
    But if you then make another copy of this root-like context, the new context will
    have it&#39;s parent set to the Default/Current context instead of staying as None.

    The idea here is, if you pass in an explicit None, then we should always use None including
    in copied.  But root-like objects are a bit special, they have no parent because they are
    supposed to be the &#39;first&#39; one, and we don&#39;t necessarily want any copies of this
    root-like context to keep using `None`.

        You can give an initial list of dependencies
        (if desired, most of the time you just start with a blank context).

        for `parent`, it can be set to `xsentinels.default.Default` (default value); or to `None.

        If you don&#39;t pass anything to parent, then the default value of `Default` will cause us
        to lookup the current context and use that for the parent automatically when the
        XContext is activated.
        For more information on activating a context see
        [Activating A XContext](#activating-a-context).

        If you pass in None for parent, no parent will be used/consulted. Normally you&#39;ll only
        want to do this for a root context. Also, useful for unit testing to isolate testing
        method dependencies from other unit tests. Right now, the unit-test Dependency isolation
        happens automatically via an auto-use fixture
        (`xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context`).

        A non-activated context will return `xsentinels.default.Default` as it&#39;s `XContext.parent`
        if it was created with the default value;
        otherwise we return `None` (if it was created that way).

            dependencies (Union[Dict[Type, Any], List[Any], Any]): If you wish to have the
                `XContext` your creating have an initial list of dependencies you can pass them
                in here.

                It can be a single Dependency, or a list of dependencies, or a mapping of
                dependencies.

                Mainly useful for unit-testing, but could be useful elsewhere too.

                They will be added to use via `XContext.add` for you.

                If you use a dict/mapping, we will use the following for `XContext.add`:

                - Dict-key as the `for_type&#39; method parameter.
                - Dict-value as the `Dependency` method parameter.

                This allows you to map some standard Dependency type into a completely different
                type (useful for unit-testing).

                By default, no dependencies are initially added to a new XContext.

            parent (Union[xsentinels.default.Default, _TreatAsRootParent, None]): If we should use
                `xsentinels.default.Default`, treat this as a root-like XContext, or use None as
                parent.

                Right now the only valid option is to do one of these three options:

                - nothing (ie: leave at `xsentinels.default.Default`): If left as
                    `xsentinels.default.Default`, We lookup current context and use that as the
                    parent in self and in copies or when self is used in a `with` statement or as
                    a decorator.
                - Pass `None`, indicating to not use any parent for current thread,
                    even if copied or used in a decorator/with-statement.
                    This means app-root, and any current thread-root will be ignored.
                - Pass `_TreatAsRootParent`, indicating to not use any parent, but allow copies
                    or when used as decorator/with-statement to use the currently activate
                    XContext as the new copies parent.

                    This option should **ONLY** be used internally in this module.

                    If you use `_TreatAsRootParent` as the value, keep in mind that a root-like
                    XContext is special, as it never has a parent and is also considered to have
                    a default parent if it&#39;s copied. A context is shallow copied, and the copy
                    activated when used as a decorator or in a `with` statement.

                    `_TreatAsRootParent ` should only be used INTERNALLY in this module,
                    it&#39;s not currently exposed publicly.

                    See `_TreatAsRootParent` for more details on root-like contexts.

            name (str): Optional name.
                If left as None, by default, this will simply assign a unique sequential
                number to the name.

                If name is passed in, it will be appended to the unique sequential number.

                When XContext is printed in a string, it will include
                this as it&#39;s name to make debugging easier.

        Lets you add a dependency to this context, you can only have one-dependency per-type.

        Returns self so that you can keep calling more methods on it easily.... this allws you
        to also add a dependency and then use it directly as decorator (only works on python 3.9),
        ie:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; # Only works on python 3.9+, it relaxes grammar restrictions
        &gt;&gt;&gt; #    (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0614/)

        ...     print(f&#34;my int dependency: {XContext.dependency(int)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my int dependency: 2&#34;

        As as side-note, you can easily add resources to a new `xinject.context.XContext` via:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext(dependencies=[2])
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     print(f&#34;my int dependency: {XContext.dependency(int)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my int dependency: 2&#34;

        With the `XContext.add` method, you can subsitute dependency for other
        dependency types, ie:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     context = XContext()
        ...     context.add(3, for_type=str)
        ...     print(f&#34;my str dependency: {XContext.dependency(str)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my str dependency: 3&#34;

        If you need to override a dependency, you can create a new context and set me as it&#39;s
        parent. At that point you can add whatever resources you want before anyone else
        uses the new `xinject.context.XContext`.

        .. warning:: If you attempt to add a second dependency of the same type...
            ...a `xinject.errors.XInjectError` will be
            raised. This is because other objects have already gotten this dependency and are
            relying on it now.  You need to configure any special resources you want to add
            to this context early enough before anything else will need it.

        .. todo:: Consider relaxing this ^ and not producing an error [or at least an option
            to &#39;replace&#39; an existing dependency in an existing Context. I was cautious on this
            at first because it was the safest thing to do and I could always relax it later
            if I found that desirable. Careful consideration would have to be made.

        Args:
            dependency (Any): Object to add as a dependency, it&#39;s type will be mapped to it.

            skip_if_present (bool): If False [default], we raise an exception if dependency
                of that type is already in context/self.

                If True, we don&#39;t do anything if dependency of that type is already in
                context/self.

            for_type: You can force a particular mapping by using this option.
                By default, the `for_type` is set to the type of the passed in dependency
                [via `type(dependency)`].

                You can override this behavior by passing a type in the `for_type` param.
                We will then map the dependency for `for_type` to the `dependency` object when
                a dependency is requested for `for_type` in the future. Will still raise the
                error if a dependency for `for_type` already exists in Context.
        Returns:
            Return `self`, so that you can keep calling more methods easily if needed
            (ie: .add(), etc)

        ## Summary

        The whole point of the `xinject.context.XContext` is to have a place to get shared
        dependencies. This method is the primary way to get a shared resource from a Contet
        directly.

        Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

        Normally a resource will inherit from `xinject.dependency.Dependency` and that
        class provides a class method `xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab` to easily get a
        resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

        So normally, code would do this to get a Resource:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Dependency):
        &gt;&gt;&gt;    pass
        &gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to get current Dependency object:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.grab()

        Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
        `xinject.proxy.CurrentDependencyProxy`. This class lets you create an object
        that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
        So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
        and use it directly.

        I would start with [Quick Start](#quick-start) if you know nothing of how
        `xinject.context.XContext` works and want to learn more about how it works.

        Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
        `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.  So getting familure with Context is more about
        utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

        ## Advanced Usage for Unit Tests

        You can allocate a new Context to inject or customize dependencies. When the context is
        thrown away or otherwise is not the current context anymore, the idea is whatever
        resource you made temporarily active is forgotten.

        You can inject/replace dependencies as needed for unit-testing purposes as well by simply
        adding the resource to a new/blank `xinject.context.XContext` as a diffrent type,
        see example below.

        In this example, we add a value of int(20) for the `str` resource type.
        I used built-int types to simplify this, but you can image using your own
        custom-resource-class and placing it in the Context for the normal-resource-type
        the normal code asks for.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; XContext().add(20, for_type=str)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; XContext().dependency(str)
        Output: 20

        ## Specific Details

        Given a type of `xinject.dependency.Dependency`, or any other type;
        we will return an instance of it.

        If we currently don&#39;t have one, we will create a new one of type passe in and return that.
        We will continue to return the one created in the future for the type passed in.

        You can customize this process a bit by having your custom resource inherit from
        `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.

        Otherwise, no other parameters will be sent to init method.

        If you have an `for_type` class of any sort
        that needs extra parameters and you want to use it as a Resource, you can create it
        yourself and add it to the Context via `add_resource`.  I would recommend in this case a
        class-method on the `for_type` class that would accept these extra parameters and then
        check the current Context and allocate or return the existing context resource as needed.

        Args:
            for_type (Type[ResourceTypeVar]): The type of resource you need, and instance of
                this type will be returned.

            create (bool): Whether to create resource if needed or not.
                If `True` [default]: creates the resource if it does not exist in self.
                If `False`: only returns an object if we have it already, otherwise None.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # If we find it in self, use that; no need to check anything else...
        obj = self._dependencies.get(for_type, None)
        if obj is not None:
            return obj

        # We next check our cached parent deps...
        obj = self._cached_parent_dependencies.get(for_type, None)
        if obj is not None:
            return obj

        # We must now query the parent-chain to find the dependency.

        # If we are the root context for the entire app (ie: app-root between all threads)
        # then we check to see if dependency is thread-sharable.
        #
        # If it is then we continue as normal.
        # If NOT, then we always return None.
        #
        # This will indicate to the thread-specific XContext that is calling us to allocate
        # the object in its self.
        #
        # If something else is asking us, we still return None because this Dependency does not
        # belong in us, and so we should not accidentally auto-create it in us.
        # ie: Whoever is calling it should handle the None case.
        #
        # In Reality, the only thing that should be calling the app-root context
        # is a thread-root context.  Thread root-contexts should never return None when asked
        # for a dependency.

            Using one of the above with a XContext also makes it &#39;active&#39;
            (see XContext._is_active for more internal details, if your interested ).

            resourced between runs. It will be &#39;fresh&#39; each time with whatever

        This allows us to support using `xinject.context.XContext` as a function decorator in a
        few ways:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
        ...     pass

        OR

        &gt;&gt;&gt; my_context = XContext()
        &gt;&gt;&gt; my_context.add(Dependency())
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @my_context
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
        ...     pass

        In either case, we will create and activate NEW context each time `some_method` is called.
        It will be thrown away after the method is finished executing.

        This allows you to make whatever changes you wish to the Context while method is
        is running and it will start fresh again next time it runs.

        In the case of a pre-allocated context, such as `my_context` in the above example;
        we will use that as the template/starting-point each time `some_method` is called;

        What this means is that when `some_method` is called, and we create this new
        `xinject.context.XContext` to use.
        The next `xinject.context.XContext` will get the same dependencies that are/were assigned
        to it; whatever it is at the time `some_method` is called.

        This allows for more fine-control of what is in the `template` context, without
        worrying about taking other changes into it that come later.

    If a `XContext` is activated a second time (perhaps when a function is called recursively, etc)
    then it makes a shallow copy of self, and sets its self as the the XContext copy&#39;s sibling
    by setting this var on the copied XContext.

    If a XContext has a sibling, when a `xinject.dependency.Dependency` is directly added to
    XContext via `XContext.add` it will also add that same dependency to the sibling XContext.

    In this way, when you do something like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
    &gt;&gt;&gt;   XContext.grab().add(SomeDependency())

    The `SomeDependency` instance will be added to all of the functions decorated XContext
    objects like you would expect
    (ie: it&#39;s treated as if one instance of XContext was created, even if `some_method` is
         called recursively).

    The shallow-copy must be made if method is called recursively so that the parent-chain

    in a way that does not really alter how XContext works.

    It should work exactly the same as the normal, non-uniting app.

XContext is activated.
For more information on activating a context see
<a href="#activating-a-context">Activating A XContext</a>.</p>
<p>If you pass in None for parent, no parent will be used/consulted. Normally you'll only
want to do this for a root context. Also, useful for unit testing to isolate testing
method dependencies from other unit tests. Right now, the unit-test Dependency isolation
happens automatically via an auto-use fixture
(<code>xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context</code>).</p>
<p>A non-activated context will return <code><a title="xsentinels.default.Default" href="../xsentinels/default.html#xsentinels.default.Default">Default</a></code> as it's <code><a title="xinject.context.XContext.parent" href="#xinject.context.XContext.parent">XContext.parent</a></code>

        You can give an initial list of dependencies

        for `parent`, it can be set to `xsentinels.default.Default` (default value); or to `None.

        If you don&#39;t pass anything to parent, then the default value of `Default` will cause us
        to lookup the current context and use that for the parent automatically when the
        XContext is activated.
        For more information on activating a context see
        [Activating A XContext](#activating-a-context).

        If you pass in None for parent, no parent will be used/consulted. Normally you&#39;ll only
        want to do this for a root context. Also, useful for unit testing to isolate testing
        method dependencies from other unit tests. Right now, the unit-test Dependency isolation
        happens automatically via an auto-use fixture
        (`xinject.ptest_plugin.xinject_test_context`).

        A non-activated context will return `xsentinels.default.Default` as it&#39;s `XContext.parent`
        if it was created with the default value;
        otherwise we return `None` (if it was created that way).

        Args:
            dependencies (Union[Dict[Type, Any], List[Any], Any]): If you wish to have the
                `XContext` your creating have an initial list of dependencies you can pass them
                in here.

                It can be a single Dependency, or a list of dependencies, or a mapping of
                dependencies.

                Mainly useful for unit-testing, but could be useful elsewhere too.

                They will be added to use via `XContext.add` for you.

                If you use a dict/mapping, we will use the following for `XContext.add`:

                - Dict-key as the `for_type&#39; method parameter.
                - Dict-value as the `Dependency` method parameter.

                This allows you to map some standard Dependency type into a completely different
                type (useful for unit-testing).

                By default, no dependencies are initially added to a new XContext.

            parent (Union[xsentinels.default.Default, _TreatAsRootParent, None]): If we should use
                `xsentinels.default.Default`, treat this as a root-like XContext, or use None as
                parent.

                Right now the only valid option is to do one of these three options:

                - nothing (ie: leave at `xsentinels.default.Default`): If left as
                    `xsentinels.default.Default`, We lookup current context and use that as the
                    parent in self and in copies or when self is used in a `with` statement or as
                    a decorator.
                - Pass `None`, indicating to not use any parent for current thread,
                    even if copied or used in a decorator/with-statement.
                    This means app-root, and any current thread-root will be ignored.
                - Pass `_TreatAsRootParent`, indicating to not use any parent, but allow copies
                    or when used as decorator/with-statement to use the currently activate
                    XContext as the new copies parent.

                    This option should **ONLY** be used internally in this module.

                    If you use `_TreatAsRootParent` as the value, keep in mind that a root-like
                    XContext is special, as it never has a parent and is also considered to have
                    a default parent if it&#39;s copied. A context is shallow copied, and the copy
                    activated when used as a decorator or in a `with` statement.

                    `_TreatAsRootParent ` should only be used INTERNALLY in this module,
                    it&#39;s not currently exposed publicly.

                    See `_TreatAsRootParent` for more details on root-like contexts.

            name (str): Optional name.
                If left as None, by default, this will simply assign a unique sequential
                number to the name.

                If name is passed in, it will be appended to the unique sequential number.

                When XContext is printed in a string, it will include
                this as it&#39;s name to make debugging easier.

        &#34;&#34;&#34;
        Lets you add a dependency to this context, you can only have one-dependency per-type.

        Returns self so that you can keep calling more methods on it easily.... this allws you
        to also add a dependency and then use it directly as decorator (only works on python 3.9),
        ie:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; # Only works on python 3.9+, it relaxes grammar restrictions
        &gt;&gt;&gt; #    (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0614/)
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext().add(2)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     print(f&#34;my int dependency: {XContext.dependency(int)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my int dependency: 2&#34;

        As as side-note, you can easily add resources to a new `xinject.context.XContext` via:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext(dependencies=[2])
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     print(f&#34;my int dependency: {XContext.dependency(int)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my int dependency: 2&#34;

        With the `XContext.add` method, you can subsitute dependency for other
        dependency types, ie:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
        ...     context = XContext()
        ...     context.add(3, for_type=str)
        ...     print(f&#34;my str dependency: {XContext.dependency(str)}&#34;)
        Output: &#34;my str dependency: 3&#34;

        If you need to override a dependency, you can create a new context and set me as it&#39;s
        parent. At that point you can add whatever resources you want before anyone else
        uses the new `xinject.context.XContext`.

        .. warning:: If you attempt to add a second dependency of the same type...
            ...a `xinject.errors.XInjectError` will be
            raised. This is because other objects have already gotten this dependency and are
            relying on it now.  You need to configure any special resources you want to add
            to this context early enough before anything else will need it.

        .. todo:: Consider relaxing this ^ and not producing an error [or at least an option
            to &#39;replace&#39; an existing dependency in an existing Context. I was cautious on this
            at first because it was the safest thing to do and I could always relax it later
            if I found that desirable. Careful consideration would have to be made.

        Args:
            dependency (Any): Object to add as a dependency, it&#39;s type will be mapped to it.

            skip_if_present (bool): If False [default], we raise an exception if dependency
                of that type is already in context/self.

                If True, we don&#39;t do anything if dependency of that type is already in
                context/self.

            for_type: You can force a particular mapping by using this option.
                By default, the `for_type` is set to the type of the passed in dependency
                [via `type(dependency)`].

                You can override this behavior by passing a type in the `for_type` param.
                We will then map the dependency for `for_type` to the `dependency` object when
                a dependency is requested for `for_type` in the future. Will still raise the
                error if a dependency for `for_type` already exists in Context.
        Returns:
            Return `self`, so that you can keep calling more methods easily if needed
            (ie: .add(), etc)

        ## Summary

        The whole point of the `xinject.context.XContext` is to have a place to get shared
        dependencies. This method is the primary way to get a shared resource from a Contet
        directly.

        Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

        Normally a resource will inherit from `xinject.dependency.Dependency` and that
        class provides a class method `xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab` to easily get a
        resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

        So normally, code would do this to get a Resource:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Dependency):
        &gt;&gt;&gt;    pass
        &gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to get current Dependency object:
        &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.grab()

        Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
        `xinject.proxy.CurrentDependencyProxy`. This class lets you create an object
        that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
        So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
        and use it directly.

        I would start with [Quick Start](#quick-start) if you know nothing of how
        `xinject.context.XContext` works and want to learn more about how it works.

        Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
        `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.  So getting familure with Context is more about
        utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

        ## Advanced Usage for Unit Tests

        You can allocate a new Context to inject or customize dependencies. When the context is
        thrown away or otherwise is not the current context anymore, the idea is whatever
        resource you made temporarily active is forgotten.

        You can inject/replace dependencies as needed for unit-testing purposes as well by simply
        adding the resource to a new/blank `xinject.context.XContext` as a diffrent type,
        see example below.

        In this example, we add a value of int(20) for the `str` resource type.
        I used built-int types to simplify this, but you can image using your own
        custom-resource-class and placing it in the Context for the normal-resource-type
        the normal code asks for.

        &gt;&gt;&gt; XContext().add(20, for_type=str)
        &gt;&gt;&gt; XContext().dependency(str)
        Output: 20

        ## Specific Details

        Given a type of `xinject.dependency.Dependency`, or any other type;
        we will return an instance of it.

        If we currently don&#39;t have one, we will create a new one of type passe in and return that.
        We will continue to return the one created in the future for the type passed in.

        You can customize this process a bit by having your custom resource inherit from
        `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.

        Otherwise, no other parameters will be sent to init method.

        If you have an `for_type` class of any sort
        that needs extra parameters and you want to use it as a Resource, you can create it
        yourself and add it to the Context via `add_resource`.  I would recommend in this case a
        class-method on the `for_type` class that would accept these extra parameters and then
        check the current Context and allocate or return the existing context resource as needed.

        Args:
            for_type (Type[ResourceTypeVar]): The type of resource you need, and instance of
                this type will be returned.

            create (bool): Whether to create resource if needed or not.
                If `True` [default]: creates the resource if it does not exist in self.
                If `False`: only returns an object if we have it already, otherwise None.
        &#34;&#34;&#34;

        # If we find it in self, use that; no need to check anything else...
        obj = self._dependencies.get(for_type, None)
        if obj is not None:
            return obj

        # We next check our cached parent deps...
        obj = self._cached_parent_dependencies.get(for_type, None)
        if obj is not None:
            return obj

        # We must now query the parent-chain to find the dependency.

        # If we are the root context for the entire app (ie: app-root between all threads)
        # then we check to see if dependency is thread-sharable.
        #
        # If it is then we continue as normal.
        # If NOT, then we always return None.
        #
        # This will indicate to the thread-specific XContext that is calling us to allocate
        # the object in its self.
        #
        # If something else is asking us, we still return None because this Dependency does not
        # belong in us, and so we should not accidentally auto-create it in us.
        # ie: Whoever is calling it should handle the None case.
        #
        # In Reality, the only thing that should be calling the app-root context
        # is a thread-root context.  Thread root-contexts should never return None when asked
        # for a dependency.
        #
        # So, code using a Dependency in general should never have to worry about this None case.

        This allows us to support using `xinject.context.XContext` as a function decorator in a
        few ways:

        &gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
        ...     pass

        OR

        &gt;&gt;&gt; my_context.add(Dependency())
        &gt;&gt;&gt;
        &gt;&gt;&gt; @my_context
        &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
        ...     pass

        In either case, we will create and activate NEW context each time `some_method` is called.
        It will be thrown away after the method is finished executing.

        This allows you to make whatever changes you wish to the Context while method is
        is running and it will start fresh again next time it runs.

        In the case of a pre-allocated context, such as `my_context` in the above example;
        we will use that as the template/starting-point each time `some_method` is called;

        What this means is that when `some_method` is called, and we create this new
        `xinject.context.XContext` to use.
        The next `xinject.context.XContext` will get the same dependencies that are/were assigned
        to it; whatever it is at the time `some_method` is called.

        This allows for more fine-control of what is in the `template` context, without
        worrying about taking other changes into it that come later.

    If a `XContext` is activated a second time (perhaps when a function is called recursively, etc)
    then it makes a shallow copy of self, and sets its self as the the XContext copy&#39;s sibling
    by setting this var on the copied XContext.

    If a XContext has a sibling, when a `xinject.dependency.Dependency` is directly added to
    XContext via `XContext.add` it will also add that same dependency to the sibling XContext.

    In this way, when you do something like this:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext()
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method()
    &gt;&gt;&gt;   XContext.grab().add(SomeDependency())

    The `SomeDependency` instance will be added to all of the functions decorated XContext
    objects like you would expect
    (ie: it&#39;s treated as if one instance of XContext was created, even if `some_method` is
         called recursively).

    The shallow-copy must be made if method is called recursively so that the parent-chain
    can be kept track of correctly along with any cached resources from the parent-chain.

    This allows us to support using `xinject.context.XContext` as a function decorator in a
    few ways:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; @XContext
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
    ...     pass

    OR

    &gt;&gt;&gt; my_context = XContext()

    &gt;&gt;&gt;
    &gt;&gt;&gt; @my_context
    &gt;&gt;&gt; def some_method():
    ...     pass

    In either case, we will create and activate NEW context each time `some_method` is called.
    It will be thrown away after the method is finished executing.

    This allows you to make whatever changes you wish to the Context while method is
    is running and it will start fresh again next time it runs.

    In the case of a pre-allocated context, such as `my_context` in the above example;
    we will use that as the template/starting-point each time `some_method` is called;

    What this means is that when `some_method` is called, and we create this new
    `xinject.context.XContext` to use.
    The next `xinject.context.XContext` will get the same dependencies that are/were assigned
    to it; whatever it is at the time `some_method` is called.

    This allows for more fine-control of what is in the `template` context, without
    worrying about taking other changes into it that come later.

            By default, the `for_type` is set to the type of the passed in dependency
            [via `type(dependency)`].

            You can override this behavior by passing a type in the `for_type` param.
            We will then map the dependency for `for_type` to the `dependency` object when
            a dependency is requested for `for_type` in the future. Will still raise the
            error if a dependency for `for_type` already exists in Context.

    ## Summary

    The whole point of the `xinject.context.XContext` is to have a place to get shared
    dependencies. This method is the primary way to get a shared resource from a Contet
    directly.

    Normally, code will use some other convenience methods, as an example:

    Normally a resource will inherit from `xinject.dependency.Dependency` and that
    class provides a class method `xinject.dependency.Dependency.grab` to easily get a
    resource of the inherited type from the current context as a convenience.

    So normally, code would do this to get a Resource:

    &gt;&gt;&gt; class SomeResource(Dependency):
    &gt;&gt;&gt;    pass
    &gt;&gt;&gt; # Normally code would do this to get current Dependency object:
    &gt;&gt;&gt; SomeResource.grab()

    Another convenient way to get the current resource is via the
    `xinject.proxy.CurrentDependencyProxy`. This class lets you create an object
    that always acts like the current/active object for some Resource.
    So you can define it at the top-level of some module, and code can import it
    and use it directly.

    I would start with [Quick Start](#quick-start) if you know nothing of how
    `xinject.context.XContext` works and want to learn more about how it works.

    Most of the time, you interact with Context indrectly via
    `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.  So getting familure with Context is more about
    utilize more advance use-cases. I get into some of these advanced use-cases below.

    ## Advanced Usage for Unit Tests

    You can allocate a new Context to inject or customize dependencies. When the context is
    thrown away or otherwise is not the current context anymore, the idea is whatever
    resource you made temporarily active is forgotten.

    You can inject/replace dependencies as needed for unit-testing purposes as well by simply
    adding the resource to a new/blank `xinject.context.XContext` as a diffrent type,
    see example below.

    In this example, we add a value of int(20) for the `str` resource type.
    I used built-int types to simplify this, but you can image using your own
    custom-resource-class and placing it in the Context for the normal-resource-type
    the normal code asks for.

    &gt;&gt;&gt; XContext().add(20, for_type=str)
    &gt;&gt;&gt; XContext().dependency(str)
    Output: 20

    ## Specific Details

    Given a type of `xinject.dependency.Dependency`, or any other type;
    we will return an instance of it.

    If we currently don&#39;t have one, we will create a new one of type passe in and return that.
    We will continue to return the one created in the future for the type passed in.

    You can customize this process a bit by having your custom resource inherit from
    `xinject.dependency.Dependency`.

    Otherwise, no other parameters will be sent to init method.

    If you have an `for_type` class of any sort
    that needs extra parameters and you want to use it as a Resource, you can create it
    yourself and add it to the Context via `add_resource`.  I would recommend in this case a
    class-method on the `for_type` class that would accept these extra parameters and then
    check the current Context and allocate or return the existing context resource as needed.

    Args:
        for_type (Type[ResourceTypeVar]): The type of resource you need, and instance of
            this type will be returned.

        create (bool): Whether to create resource if needed or not.
            If `True` [default]: creates the resource if it does not exist in self.
            If `False`: only returns an object if we have it already, otherwise None.
    &#34;&#34;&#34;

    # If we find it in self, use that; no need to check anything else...
    obj = self._dependencies.get(for_type, None)
    if obj is not None:
        return obj

    # We next check our cached parent deps...
    obj = self._cached_parent_dependencies.get(for_type, None)
    if obj is not None:
        return obj

    # We must now query the parent-chain to find the dependency.

    # If we are the root context for the entire app (ie: app-root between all threads)
    # then we check to see if dependency is thread-sharable.
    #
    # If it is then we continue as normal.
    # If NOT, then we always return None.
    #
    # This will indicate to the thread-specific XContext that is calling us to allocate
    # the object in its self.
    #
    # If something else is asking us, we still return None because this Dependency does not
    # belong in us, and so we should not accidentally auto-create it in us.
    # ie: Whoever is calling it should handle the None case.
    #
    # In Reality, the only thing that should be calling the app-root context
    # is a thread-root context.  Thread root-contexts should never return None when asked
    # for a dependency.
    #
    # So, code using a Dependency in general should never have to worry about this None case.

    if self._is_root_context_for_app:
        from xinject.dependency import is_dependency_thread_sharable
        if not is_dependency_thread_sharable(for_type):

        # The current context is `active` along with it&#39;s parent-chain....
        # So this should be safe.
        # Doing an assert here to at least minimally double check this.
        parent = XContext.grab()
        if self is parent:
            raise XInjectError(
                f&#34;Somehow have self ({self}) and parent as same instance (XContext), &#34;

        # Since our `parent is Default`, we should not be the app-root, or thread-root

        return parent.dependency(for_type, create=create)

    if parent:

        return obj

    # Store in self for future reuse.
